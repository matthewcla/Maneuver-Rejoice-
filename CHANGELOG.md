# Changelog

## Unreleased
- Converted static radar backdrop to true polar grid with radial bearing lines.
- Added adjustable constants for grid styling.
- Verified no performance regression: static grid recalculates only when dirty or canvas size changes.
- Restored numeric range labels in faint green and removed cardinal direction labels.
- Extended bearing lines beyond the outer ring for clearer reference.
- Trimmed non-cardinal bearing lines within the polar plot and shortened their
  outer segment by 20% while preserving cardinal line lengths.
- Removed bearing line segments inside the outer range ring so all bearings now
  originate at the ring itself.
- ORCA max neighbors increased to 15 with neighbor distances reset each step.
  TODO: enable sector-pruning when more than 50 agents are simulated.
